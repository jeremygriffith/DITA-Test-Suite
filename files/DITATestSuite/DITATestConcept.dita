<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the <keyword keyref="dts" /> is to provide a common set of
acceptance tests for tools used to create output from DITA maps and
topics.  It is tested against two processors, the <term keyref="DITAOT"/>
and <term keyref="DITA2Go">Omni Systems' DITA2Go</term>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>Suite Components</title>
<p>The <keyword keyref="dts" /> consists of two independent DITA projects,
one based on a bookmap and the other on a ditamap, that are output
separately. The two projects reference each other via xrefs, related
topics, and reltables.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>Expected Results</title>
<p>The <keyword keyref="dts" /> includes both DITA documents and the expected 
output from the tested toolsets in several formats, including PDF, 
HTML and XHTML for the Web, Microsoft HTML Help, and Eclipse Help.</p>
